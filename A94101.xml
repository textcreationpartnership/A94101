            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ſhould not have a royall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with His Aunceſters;</hi> the cauſes were nearer thee, Let me aſſigne them:</p>
            <p>Firſt, it had been a Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of your ſelves to have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him ſolemne and Kingly Funeralls, unto whom you gave ſo unjuſt and cruell a death, that were <hi>to build up what you were reſolved to destroy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next, you could not but know, that the neighbourhood of his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred earthly remains muſt needs refricate the ſcarce skinn'd ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of <hi>London;</hi> when they ſhould have ſuch a ſtanding and ſtill preſent Monument of their former happineſſe, in His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties peaceable Government; and of their new miſery in your Tyranny, which would ſerve alſo (this being the place of the greateſt confluence) to recrude the griefe of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and probably beget ſuch

compunction and reluctancy in both City and Kingdome, as would teſtifie it ſelfe, by their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to caſt you downe head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long from your new and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquired Dominion.</p>
            <p>Another reaſon was, leſt the nearneſſe of his Body whom you murthered, might too frequently offer unto you the horror of your Guilt, and redouble unto you thoſe inward cheques and laſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of your Conſciences (which you cannot be without) and ſo impede and trouble your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</p>

See one of

the moſt potent <hi>Monarchs of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> loved at home, and feared abroad, moſt injuriouſly and ſtrictly Impriſoned, debarred from the moſt deare ſociety of the moſt virtuous and beſt Wife, from the converſe and ſight of his moſt ſweet &amp; hopefull Children, from the attendance of his moſt faithfull Servants, from Gods houſe, from Gods publique wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, &amp; all Gods Servants, forc'd to cohabite with Beaſts, brutiſh, ſavage, and wicked Men, &amp; theſe to be made the Inſtruments of their cruelty unto him, who were his ſworne Subjects and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, upon whom all civill and divine obligations of duty and affection unto His Majeſty reſted, and that upon <hi>pretenſions of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and liberty,</hi> of which <hi>He was the trueſt and moſt undoubted De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender;</hi> to lie under the weight and wounds of ſo many ſcandals, reproaches, wants, and miſeries;

as beyond expreſſion, ſo above our conception; moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible teſts, and trials of all his virtues; certainly no man had ever more, and more ſtrict exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of Gods graces in him, all which he fully anſwered with a learned and invincible piety; for in all theſe who ever heard him murmure, repine, or <hi>charge God fooliſhly?</hi> who ever heard him accuſe, raile at, or threaten his moſt confirmed Foes? with <hi>Job,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But it was the great and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilt of theſe Nations ſinnes
